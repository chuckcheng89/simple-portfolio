<h1>The Best Movies According to Chuck</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>La Grande Vadrouille</h3>
<p>This is the first movie that I remembered watching when I was a child. It is a pure comedy and a classic. It will always be in my heart because my mother and I used to watch it together and sharing a great time.</p>
<h3>1900</h3>
<p>Like the piano and the purity of the main character. Always follow by his heart. Although the end is very unfortunate.</p>
<h3>Marvel's Movies</h3>
<p>Simple but sometimes telling us great stories of morality</p>
